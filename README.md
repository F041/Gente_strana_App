Quirky people: find (neurodiverse) people like you

This app looks a bit like Tandem, the language exchange app, and connected2me. It has 2 languages, Italian and English, you can see it in res/values/strings and res/values-en/strings
The user interace of the screenshots you see, might change in the future

to do:
- fix status of messages (sent, delivered, read)
- profile pics gallery of user
- fix topics in profilecard and uniform it to personalProfileScreen
- sort usersListScreen by last active and remove the user's personal profile from the list

if you fork this, you'd need to edit some strings in res/values/strings and res/values-en/strings, like the appname. And of course you'd need your own Firebase instance on google. Tham means also spitting blood with Firestore Database rules.
