## About
an app designed to help people who belongs to the *neurodiverse group* to find and connect with others like them.  If you seek a community where you don't perceive yourself as a fish outside its bowl,  with people that experienced the same, this app aims to provide a space for that.

This app looks a bit like Tandem, the language exchange app, and connected2me. It has 2 languages, Italian and English, you can see it in res/values/strings and res/values-en/strings
The user interace of the screenshots you see, might change in the future

currently available in two languages: Italian and English. You can see the text used in the app in the ```res/values/strings``` and ```res/values-en/strings``` files if you feel interested in the technical details. 

The visual design of the app, as shown in the screenshots, might change as I develop it further. 

## Features
* Connect with quirky people:  find and chat other neurodiverse individuals. You can find them via the topic, for example. Maybe you get along with people obsessed with trains or birds. Or that collects Pokemon cards.
* Multilingual support: app available in both Italian and English.
     

### To do:
- profile pics gallery of user
- fix topics in profilecard and uniform it to personalProfileScreen
- sort usersListScreen by last active and remove the user's personal profile from the list
- translations for bio, topics

### Customizing the App (For Developers)

if you fork this, you'd need to edit some strings in ```res/values/strings``` and ```res/values-en/strings```, like the appname. And of course you'd need your own Firebase instance on google. Tham means also spitting blood with Firestore Database rules.


### Disclaimer
I developed this app with 3 gen AIs. 
If you don't know the meaning of neurodiversity or you never got labeled as *weird*, most likely this app doesn't fit you, it could even trigger your uneasiness
