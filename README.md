## About
an app designed to help people who belongs to the *neurodiverse group* to find and connect with others like them.  If you seek a community where you don't perceive yourself as a fish outside its bowl,  with people that experienced the same, this app aims to provide a space for that.

This app looks a bit like Tandem, the language exchange app, and connected2me. It has 2 languages, Italian and English, you can see it in res/values/strings and res/values-en/strings
The user interace of the screenshots you see, might change in the future

currently available in two languages: Italian and English. You can see the text used in the app in the ```res/values/strings``` and ```res/values-en/strings``` files if you feel interested in the technical details. 

The visual design of the app, as shown in the screenshots, might change as I develop it further. 

## Features
* Connect with quirky people:  find and chat other neurodiverse individuals. You can find them via the topic, for example. Maybe you get along with people obsessed with trains or birds. Or that collects Pokemon cards.
* Multilingual support: app available in both Italian and English (default).
* Themes: dark, white, system (white) and "special".
* You can report and or block users. This can happen in such community too. 

## Why "GS" as logo?
As you read from the name of this repository, Gente Strana becomes the Italian version of Quirky People. The infinite became the symbol of neurodiverse people, hence the logo that reminds that symbol. A bit more difficult to create that with the initials Q and P of Quirky People. The dots inside the letters represent a social network. 
     

### To do:
- sort usersListScreen by last active and remove the user's personal profile from the list
- translations for bio, topics
- speacial theme for who has dyslexia
- facebook registration and login

### Customizing the App (For Developers)

if you fork this, you'd need to edit some strings in ```res/values/strings``` and ```res/values-en/strings```, like the appname. And of course you'd need your own Firebase instance on google. Tham means also spitting blood with Firestore Database rules.
This repo doesn't come with Firebase Functions, that help, for example, to manage notifications.


### Disclaimer
I developed this app with 3 gen AIs. 
If you don't know the meaning of neurodiversity or you never got labeled as *weird*, most likely this app doesn't fit you, it could even trigger your uneasiness
